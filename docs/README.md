## Features

- Reduce a given object to match the structure and leaf data types of a given map
- Delete non-matching input nodes
- Optionally throw an error for non-matching nodes with throwErrorOnAlien
- Provide options:
    - keepKeys: Retain mismatched keys as null opposed to deleting them
    - throwErrorOnAlien: Throw error on alien found
    - allowNullishKeys: Preserve null or undefined keys in the output
    - permitEmptyMap: If true, will not attempt to reduce the input when the map is an empty object
    - permitUndefinedMap: If true, will not attempt to reduce the input when the map is undefined

## Breaking changes 1 -> 2

In version 1 a bug was discovered that permitted alien keys of null value into the output. This has now been resolved
however may cause any tools using this helper tool to break, hence the major version bump.

## Example use as an API output transformer

An example use case of this package can be found in the TypeScript openapi-nodegen templates as an output
transformer: [openapi-nodegen-typescript-server](https://github.com/acr-lfr/openapi-nodegen-typescript-server/blob/master/src/http/nodegen/routes/___op.ts.njk#L31)

## Example usages

The most up-to-date examples can always
be [found in the tests of this project](https://github.com/j-d-carmichael/object-reduce-by-map/tree/master/__tests__)
